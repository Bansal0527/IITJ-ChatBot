Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur (IIT Jodhpur or IITJ) is a public technical university located in Jodhpur in the 
state of Rajasthan in India. It is one of the eight new Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) established by the 
Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India under The Institutes of Technology (Amendment) Act, 2011 
which declares these eight IITs as well as the conversion of the Institute of Technology, Banaras Hindu University to 
IIT.The Act was passed in the Lok Sabha on 24 March 2011[4] and by the Rajya Sabha on 30 April 2012.

History:
IIT Jodhpur was first announced by the Central Government in July 2007, although the formal announcement was made in 2008, with IIT Kanpur mentoring IIT Jodhpur[citation needed]. In July 2008, the first academic session of IIT Jodhpur began at the IIT Kanpur campus, with 109 undergraduate students in Computer Science Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Electrical Engineering. The institute was sanctioned as an IIT for Rajasthan, and not for Jodhpur in specific. It was after considering various cities, including Ajmer, Bikaner, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Kota and Udaipur that the Prof. Vijay Shankar Vyas led committee suggested Jodhpur as the location for the IIT in Rajasthan. In late 2009, the MHRD granted final approval for establishing the institute at Jodhpur.

A portion of the MBM Engineering College under JNV University, Jodhpur was identified as the location for the transit campus of IIT Jodhpur. In May 2010, classes of IIT Jodhpur were shifted from IIT Kanpur to the transit campus in Jodhpur. In July 2017, the academic and residential campuses of IIT Jodhpur were migrated to the permanent campus. Construction of the permanent campus is still in progress.

Permanent campus:
IITJ is located about 24 km from Jodhpur city on National Highway 65 which connects Jodhpur to Nagaur. The site spans over 852 acres (3.45 km2) of land around Jhipasni and Gharao villages. M. M. Pallam Raju, then Union Minister for Human Resources Development, laid the foundation stone on 16 April 2013.

The permanent campus is being built on a self-sustainable model, catering for its own energy and water requirements. The campus' masterplan got 'GRIHA Exemplary Performance Award' under 'Passive Architecture Design' category at the 8th GRIHA Summit held during 2–3 March 2017, at India Habitat Centre, New Delhi.



Transit academic campus:
Until the first migration of IITJ to the permanent campus, IIT Jodhpur used to function from its transit campus, at the Department of Computer Science, MBM Engineering College. The transit campus is separate from the main campus of MBM Engineering College. The transit academic campus has 20 laboratories, six classrooms of 50-person capacity and four classrooms of 200-person capacity. Two of the four large classrooms have networking and video conferencing facility to facilitate video-conferencing lectures.

The academic campus' sports facilities include basketball, football, cricket, volleyball and badminton courts.

Transit residential campus
IIT Jodhpur had set up its transit residential campus at Kendranchal colony on New Pali Road, Jodhpur. Faculty and students used to reside in the transit residential campus, which had a dining facility and a health center. It has courts for outdoor and indoor sports. There was a computer center and library annexure.

The residential campus was connected to the academic campus by institute's buses which run at frequent intervals.
